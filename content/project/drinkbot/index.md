One of my current projects is a cocktail mixing robot. This is an idea I have had for quite a while after I won an
Arduino from an Integral Bee and read [this](https://makezine.com/projects/build-cocktail-drinkbot/) blog post. I never
got the Arduino due to the people who organized the competition losing it in the mail (sad I know), but the idea
remained nonetheless. I got some other friends involved, and we found some more [inspiration](http://2019.deeplocal.com/mocktailsmixer/),
so off we went.

## Recipes

One of the initial ideas we wanted was a dynamic way of getting all possible recipes from what ingredients were available
similar to the way that [cocktailbuilders.com](www.cocktailbuilders.com) gives you cocktail recipes. To do that, we
needed to be able to query some available database with our ingredients to see what we could make. That's when we
discovered the [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php), a REST API that can return recipes based on ingredients.

Still a work in progress
