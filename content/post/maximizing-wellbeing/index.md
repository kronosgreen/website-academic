All that exists in our reality exists within our subjective experience, and by appreciating this fact, we can develop the mindset and awareness to enjoy wellbeing to its fullest regardless of our situation.

Consciousness, its origins, and the role it plays in our ability to perceive existence is something still ill understood, but we can say that everything that is or that exists from a first person perspective exists within there. Your consciousness observes a model of reality that is constructed by the brain and is constantly updated by the senses. This model also interacts with itself in the form of thoughts or the ego or the self or whatever you want to call it. You know what it is like to look at a painting and think about it, to appreciate the colors and whatnot. What it is like or that likeness that you are knowing is consciousness's observing and what <i>it</i> is, is the internal model that I previously mentioned. Put in other words, if the experience of looking at a painting is software, and the ego thinking about it is the operating system, consciousness is the hardware. The wires, transistors, processor, and so on. The hardware does not care what type of operating system it's running in the sense that they are simply the conduit through which electricity runs through in increasing complexity. The hardware simply <i>is</i> as consciousness simply is.  

Appreciating that distinction between consciousness which is <i>what it is like</i> to exist and the internal model that the brain constructs which is what we usually identify with and does interact with the external world liberates you in a sense. If you stop identifying with the internal model then when a thought emerges, it no longer has the power it once had when you identified with the model that originated it. It is relegated to simply being a thought that emerges. In the same way that the thought loses its power once you stop identifying with it, so does the external world.

This shift in perspective on who <i>you</i> are all occurs from within. This can happen in your bedroom, lying in bed looking at your phone. The way you can practice this detachment from one's ego (the internal model) is through meditation which is something that has thousands of free resources online (I suggest simply sitting cross-legged and focusing on one's breathing as if the stomach were a balloon inflating and deflating, refocusing on the stomach whenever thoughts begin to emerge). This can also be done in the comfort of one's bedroom. The point to this is that, if you think of your reality being made up of consciousness, the internal model, and the external feedback (the outside world), changing the world around you to allow you to have a better attitude (e.g. I'll be happy when I make x dollars a year) sounds a lot more challenging than simply shifting your perspective so that you simply don't identify with those things. Because of the limits of our subjective experience, one can only experience so much wellbeing anyways, and making it so that your perspective allows you to be there most to all of the time is the most efficient way of achieving that if that is a goal that one aims for. I doubt the state of wellbeing somebody well off experiences is that far off from what someone living in a developing country can bring themselves to feel. The grass is greener on the other side, so why not

There are stressful things in my life, but I am not stressed. I face disappointing things, but I am not disappointed. There are tragedies all around, but I am not dejected at the fact. I just am. Starting from that position, it becomes easy to begin addressing the things previously mentioned. Rather than bathe in the emotion or thought, one can put that energy more productively towards resolving it.

Am I saying that someone in the worst of situations can all of a sudden be the happiest person alive. No. But, at the very least, this gives that person an extra tool to endure the situation. That being said, most maladies of the modern world are things that can be addressed by this paradigm shift.

If you would like to explore these ideas further, I recommend thinkers like Sam Harris, Richard Langer, Alan Watts, and my favorite which was recommended to me by my Eastern Philosophy professor years ago, Benjamin Hoff and his book, Tao of Pooh.
