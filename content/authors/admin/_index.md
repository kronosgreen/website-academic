I'm a graduate student at Florida Polytechnic University currently finishing my thesis: Methodology for Autonomous Vehicle Validation & Verification in Simulation (MAVVVS). I also work part-time at Universal Orlando Resort as a simulation and data visualization programmer.

It is my goal to take the technical proficiency I've developed studying Computer Science and work on solving problems in the economic world in these interesting times we live in.
